   - Verify output format and content
   - Test error conditions and edge cases
   - Validate performance with large inputs

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test with Claude Code CLI system
   - Verify component installation process
   - Test cross-platform compatibility
   - Validate with different project structures

3. **Documentation Testing**
   - Verify all examples work as documented
   - Test argument descriptions and options
   - Validate process steps and outcomes
   - Check for clarity and completeness

## Command Creation Workflow

When creating new CLI commands:

### 1. Create the Command File

- **Location**: Always create new commands in `settings/claude/commands/`
- **Naming**: Use kebab-case: `optimize-images.md`
- **Format**: Markdown with specific structure and $ARGUMENTS placeholder

### 2. File Creation Process

```bash
# Create the command file
/settings/claude/commands/optimize-images.md
```

### 3. Content Structure

```markdown
# Image Optimizer

Optimize images in $ARGUMENTS for web performance and reduced file sizes.

## Task

I'll analyze and optimize images including:

1. Compress JPEG, PNG, and WebP files
2. Generate responsive image variants
3. Add proper alt text suggestions
4. Create optimized file structure

## Process

I'll follow these steps:

1. Scan directory for image files
2. Analyze current file sizes and formats
3. Apply compression algorithms
4. Generate multiple size variants
5. Create optimization report

## Optimization Types

### Compression
- Lossless compression for PNG files
- Quality optimization for JPEG files
- Modern WebP format conversion

### Responsive Images
- Generate multiple breakpoint sizes
- Create srcset attributes
- Optimize for different device densities

I'll adapt to your project's needs and follow performance best practices.
```

### 4. Installation Command Result

After creating the command, users can install it with:

```bash
npx claude-code-templates@latest --command="optimize-images" --yes
```

This will:

- Read from `cli-tool/components/commands/optimize-images.md`
- Copy the command to the user's `.claude/commands/` directory
- Enable the command for Claude Code usage

### 5. Usage in Claude Code

Users can then run the command in Claude Code:

```
/optimize-images src/assets/images
```

### 6. Testing Workflow

1. Create the command file in correct location
2. Test the installation command
3. Verify the command works with various arguments
4. Test error handling and edge cases
5. Ensure output is clear and actionable

When creating CLI commands, always:

- Create files in `cli-tool/components/commands/` directory
- Follow the Markdown format exactly as shown in examples
- Use $ARGUMENTS placeholder for user input
- Include comprehensive task descriptions and processes
- Test with the CLI installation command
- Provide actionable and specific outputs
- Document all parameters and options clearly

If you encounter requirements outside CLI command scope, clearly state the limitation and suggest appropriate resources or alternative approaches.
