## Agent Creation Workflow

When creating new specialized agents:

### 1. Create the Agent File
- **Location**: Always create new agents in `cli-tool/components/agents/`
- **Naming**: Use kebab-case: `frontend-security.md`
- **Format**: YAML frontmatter + Markdown content

### 2. File Creation Process
```bash
# Create the agent file
/cli-tool/components/agents/frontend-security.md
```

### 3. Required YAML Frontmatter Structure
```yaml
---
name: frontend-security
description: Use this agent when securing frontend applications. Specializes in XSS prevention, CSP implementation, and secure authentication flows. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to secure React app user: 'My React app is vulnerable to XSS attacks' assistant: 'I'll use the frontend-security agent to analyze and implement XSS protections' <commentary>Frontend security issues require specialized expertise</commentary></example>
color: red
---
```

**Required Frontmatter Fields:**
- `name`: Unique identifier (kebab-case, matches filename)
- `description`: Clear description with 2-3 usage examples in specific format
- `color`: Display color (red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan, white, gray)

### 4. Agent Content Structure
```markdown
You are a Frontend Security specialist focusing on web application security vulnerabilities and protection mechanisms.

Your core expertise areas:
- **XSS Prevention**: Input sanitization, Content Security Policy, secure templating
- **Authentication Security**: JWT handling, session management, OAuth flows
- **Data Protection**: Secure storage, encryption, API security

## When to Use This Agent

Use this agent for:
- XSS and injection attack prevention
- Authentication and authorization security
- Frontend data protection strategies

## Security Implementation Examples

### XSS Prevention
```javascript
// Secure input handling
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

const sanitizeInput = (userInput) => {
  return DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput, {
    ALLOWED_TAGS: ['b', 'i', 'em', 'strong'],
    ALLOWED_ATTR: []
  });
};
```

Always provide specific, actionable security recommendations with code examples.
```

### 5. Installation Command Result
After creating the agent, users can install it with:
```bash
npx claude-code-templates@latest --agent="frontend-security" --yes
```

This will:
- Read from `cli-tool/components/agents/frontend-security.md`
- Copy the agent to the user's `.claude/agents/` directory
- Enable the agent for Claude Code usage

### 6. Usage in Claude Code
Users can then invoke the agent in conversations:
- Claude Code will automatically suggest this agent for frontend security questions
- Users can reference it explicitly when needed

### 7. Testing Workflow
1. Create the agent file in correct location with proper frontmatter
2. Test the installation command
3. Verify the agent works in Claude Code context
4. Test agent selection with various prompts
5. Ensure expertise boundaries are clear

### 8. Example Creation
```markdown
---
name: react-performance
description: Use this agent when optimizing React applications. Specializes in rendering optimization, bundle analysis, and performance monitoring. Examples: <example>Context: User has slow React app user: 'My React app is rendering slowly' assistant: 'I'll use the react-performance agent to analyze and optimize your rendering' <commentary>Performance issues require specialized React optimization expertise</commentary></example>
