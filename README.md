A comprehensive Windows developer setup automation repository containing PowerShell scripts to install and configure development tools, IDEs, and environments for new developers. Features modular installation scripts and symbolic link-based configuration management.

**Key Features:**
- **Automated Tool Installation**: WinGet-based package management with progress tracking
- **Configuration Management**: Symbolic links for centralized settings (Git, VSCode, PowerShell)
- **Developer Fonts**: Cascadia Code font installation for optimal coding experience
- **Modular Architecture**: Separate scripts for different installation components

**Note:** All scripts automatically request Administrator privileges when needed - no need to "Run as Administrator" manually.

## Prerequisites

- **Windows 10/11** - Modern Windows operating system
- **PowerShell 5.1+** - Included with Windows (PowerShell 7+ will be installed)
- **Administrator Access** - User account with elevation privileges (scripts handle elevation automatically)
- **Internet Connection** - Required for downloading packages and tools

## Quick Start

### Two-Step Setup Process

1. **Install Development Tools**
   ```powershell
   .\install.ps1
   ```
   - Installs WinGet package manager (if not present)
   - Installs development tools, IDEs, and utilities via WinGet
   - Installs Cascadia Code developer fonts
   - Installs curated VSCode extensions

2. **Configure Development Environment**
   ```powershell
   .\configure.ps1
   ```
   - Creates symbolic links for configuration files
   - Sets up Git, VSCode, Windows Terminal, and PowerShell profiles
   - Links custom hosts file and system configurations

### Architecture Overview

This repository uses a **modular architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

- **Core Scripts** (`install.ps1`, `configure.ps1`) - Main entry points with automatic elevation
- **Installation Modules** (`installs/` directory) - Specialized installation scripts for different components
- **Configuration Files** (`settings/` directory) - Centralized settings that get symlinked to user directories
- **Symbolic Link Management** - Configuration files stay in the repository and are linked to system locations

**ðŸ’¡ Tip**: You can run scripts from any PowerShell prompt or double-click them - they automatically request elevation when needed.

For detailed information about the symbolic link creation process, path validation, and multi-path support, see the [Installation Scripts documentation](installs/README.md#symbolic-link-management).

> **Note**: Git and Visual Studio configurations are referenced in configure.ps1 but the actual configuration files are not included in the repository to avoid overwriting personal settings.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **UAC Elevation** | Scripts fail to run with permissions error | Click "Yes" when UAC prompt appears (automatic elevation) |
| **Execution Policy** | PowerShell blocks script execution | Scripts use `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` during elevation |
| **WinGet Installation** | Package installation fails | Script tries multiple installation methods with fallback |
| **VSCode Extensions** | Extensions fail to install | Verify VSCode is installed and `code` command is in PATH |
| **Symbolic Link Creation** | Configuration linking fails | Ensure target files exist in `settings/` directory |
| **Path Not Found** | Scripts can't find components | Run scripts from repository root directory |
